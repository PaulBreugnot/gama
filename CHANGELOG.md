# Major changes from 1.9.1 to 1.9.2

**The GAMA development team is pleased to announce the release of GAMA 1.9.2**. This is a maintenance release, aiming at fixing bugs observed in 1.9.1 and clarifying some of its concepts. No new features have been added, except the possibility to define `#mouse_drag` `event`s. 

# Detailed changes.

This release of GAMA contains new features and fixes, including:

* 2D displays can now also be locked (only from the user interface currently)
* A new event has been introduced: `mouse_drag`, an example is available in the model library: [msi.gama.models/models/Visualization and User Interaction/User Interaction/models/Mouse Drag.gaml](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/blob/GAMA_1.9.2/msi.gama.models/models/Visualization%20and%20User%20Interaction/User%20Interaction/models/Mouse%20Drag.gaml)

* Introducing different formats used internally for `memorize`/`record` experiments that can be: `xml`, the legacy one, or two new ones: `json` and `binary` (both faster and more memory efficient) and can be set with the `format` facet of the experiment.
* Fixing issues in the script `gama-headless.sh` used in macOS ([#3766](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/issues/3766) and this [commit](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/commit/1f0436ea9f668283f4824aefba5d0f1b13274318))
* Multiple fixes on the `moran` operator (see this [issue](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/issues/3848), this [commit](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/commit/a4f3aad5d4dc9dfa56d5b5e4a9a8dda671f249b5) and [this one](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/commit/01fa686a905bb2e37314496ab14a2b4a24d8ea07))

* Fixes the `copy` operator on `shape` variables
* New splash screen
* Improves the navigation in the parameter by not refreshing it completely when one parameter changes (for example in batch mode)

* Various general fixes in the display of svg
* All the geometries defined in an svg file are now accessible separately (allowing to draw only some of them, or to have different color for each for example)
* Adds a parameter to set an automatic `z` increment in between layers in opengl

## Changes that can impact models
### ðŸ”´ Errors ðŸ”´: concepts that cannot be used anymore 


### ðŸ”´ Errors ðŸ”´: concepts that need to be written differently

* All skills belonging to the "driving" skill have been renamed for more intuitive names, the skill `advanced_driving` has been replaced by `driving`, the skill `skill_road` is replaced by `road_skill` and `skill_road_node` is replaced by `intersection_skill`

* The `loop` statements using a `step` facet are not casting the `step` value into an `int` anymore which means that if you had loops that used `float` variables as a step, they may behave differently.

* casting colors (`rgb` type) into different types changed in some cases:
  * casting an `rgb` into a `float` now returns the same result as casting to an `int` instead of returning `0`
  * casting an `rgb` into a `point` now returns a point formed like this `{red, green, blue}` instead of `{0,0,0}`
  * casting an `rgb` into a `list` now returns a list of its four components: red, green, blue and alpha instead of just red, green and blue

* casting a `string` into a `list` now returns a list of string composed of all the letters of the original `string`. For example: `list("some string")` will return this list: `["s", "o", "m", "e", " ", "s", "t", "r", "i", "n", "g"]`

* casting into a `pair` has been homogenized, overall most cases are kept unchanged but some fringe cases are eliminated. The general rule is that casting anything into a `pair` will now result in a pair where the first and the second elements are the same initial object. For example: `pair([1,2,3])` will return this pair: `[1,2,3]::[1,2,3]`. The only exceptions are casting a `pair` into a `pair` which will result in no change, and casting a `map` into a `pair` that will result in a pair where the first element is the list of keys of the map and the second is the list of values of the map.

* The gama-server command `fetch` has been split into two different commands: `upload` and `download` and cannot be used anymore. See [here](https://gama-platform.org/wiki/HeadlessServer#the-download-command) the documentation on how to use those commands.

* The type of experiment `memorize` should be renamed `record`. In addition there's now two additional facets you can set for `memorize`/`record` experiments: `format` and `compress`. The `format` facet indicates the internal format used to save each step, and can be `"xml"`, `"binary"` or `"json"`. The `compress` facet indicates whether or not the saved step should be compressed or not. Compressed ones will take less memory in the long run, but will take more time to save/load.

## Added models
The library of models has undergone some changes. Besides making sure all the models compile and run fine under the new version of GAMA, it also brings some new models, which are listed below:

* A model to showcase the use of SVG files: [ummisco.gaml.extensions.image/models/Images/models/SVG Manipulation.gaml](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/blob/cfda0e49894472cd1475b055f886715d056222f4/ummisco.gaml.extensions.image/models/Images/models/SVG%20Manipulation.gaml)
* An example model to test the new `mouse_drag` event: [msi.gama.models/models/Visualization and User Interaction/User Interaction/models/Mouse Drag.gaml](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/blob/GAMA_1.9.2/msi.gama.models/models/Visualization%20and%20User%20Interaction/User%20Interaction/models/Mouse%20Drag.gaml)
* Pedestrian movement following Mehdi Moussaid's model: [msi.gama.models/models/Toy Models/Pedestrian/models/Moussaid model.gaml](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/blob/3192728f30e9ee89245ca89b1cfad4bd5e75f8ce/msi.gama.models/models/Toy%20Models/Pedestrian/models/Moussaid%20model.gaml) 
* A new example of data importation to get a mapbox image as a background of the simulation: [msi.gama.models/models/Data/Data Importation/models/MapBox Image Import As Background Image.gaml](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/blob/cfda0e49894472cd1475b055f886715d056222f4/msi.gama.models/models/Data/Data%20Importation/models/MapBox%20Image%20Import%20As%20Background%20Image.gaml)
